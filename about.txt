Hello, my name is Mike.
I created Parking Lot Tycoon for fun and as an experiment. This game was coded entirely using AI agents through Cursor.

The graphics were obtained from freepik.com by the author marcovector under a free license @ <a href="http://www.freepik.com">Designed by macrovector / Freepik</a>.

I've always liked game design, but the entry barriers for making videos games has always been very steep. It remarkable how AI tools have alleviated this. For that reason, I host my game for free.

However, I'd like to develop my ideas more, and through funding I may be able to do so. If you enjoyed Parking Lot Tycoon and would like to support my hobby, I accept donations through this bitcoin address: bc1q373dfyw4mmtkq4j38t584z3cla9p4nxuf5e4q6
