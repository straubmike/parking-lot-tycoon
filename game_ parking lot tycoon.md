Parking Lot Tycoon is a tycoon game done in the style of classic isometric games like Sim City 2000 and Roller Coaster Tycoon.

The game is a single-player browser based game that includes a series of challenges for the player to complete. These challenges increase in scope and difficulty, both teaching and requiring the player for more as they progress.

**Core Game**  
At its core, the game asks the player to design a profitable parking lot, using various ploppables and the player’s own design skills to better serve a virtual customer’s parking experience.

Each challenge starts the player with a lot size and a budget. Once certain conditions have been met, the player can open the lot to allow virtual parking NPCs into the lot, gaining profit and rating.

Time, rating, and other conditions later resolve the challenge as a pass or fail, and the player’s various metrics can be compared on a leaderboard.

**Style**  
The game is drawn in an isometric style with simple textures and 2D sprites to represent 3D space.
